description: "\"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies\" is the fourteenth episode and winter\
  \ finale of the third season, and 58th episode overall from the Fox series Gotham.\
  \ It is also the last episode to have the subtitle \"Mad City\". The episode was\
  \ written by Seth Boston and directed by Louis Shaw Milito. It was first broadcast\
  \ on January 30, 2017.\nIn the episode, with Gotham now falling into darkness, Jerome\
  \ and his followers begin to wreak havoc across the city while Jerome kidnaps Bruce\
  \ to finish what he started on the night he died. His plan includes taking him to\
  \ a carnival where citizens are used as the attractions for his amusement while\
  \ Gordon, Alfred and Bullock rush to stop him. Meanwhile, Cobblepot sets off to\
  \ find Nygma but soon discovers in which side Nygma is on. The episode is heavily\
  \ based on the popular graphic novels The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns\
  \ on which certain events are applied to the series.\nThe episode received enormous\
  \ praise from critics, with significant praise towards the nods to the comics, Mazouz's\
  \ and Monaghan's performance and the ending.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
